# Internal FAQ Chatbot

A lightweight internal chatbot that helps employees quickly find answers to common company questions. The system uses **sentence embeddings** generated by a pretrained transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to match user queries with the most relevant FAQ. By computing **semantic similarity** between the userâ€™s question and stored FAQs, the chatbot returns accurate answers even if the query is phrased differently from the stored questions.
